Marvin is the highly configurable UI component of the Intel Instrumentation 
Framework project.

To compile, run:
gradlew build

Resulting Marvin.Jar will be in the build\libs directory. Copy this to where 
you have your application setup - the .jar file should be at same location as
the Widgets directory.
