The Enzo library contains controls that I use in my projects and demos. This controls are based on JavaFX 8 and will only run with JDK 8.

You will find controls like

   * Gauges
   * LCD
   * Led
   * Notifications (like Growl)
   * Switches
   * Clocks
   * and more...

Please keep in mind that this controls are **NOT** production ready because I mainly use them for demos.

You could also find the compiled version on [bintray](https://bintray.com/hansolo/Enzo)
